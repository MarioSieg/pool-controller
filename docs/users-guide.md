## MQTT Interface

The Smart Swimmingpool Controller uses MQTT to communicate with your smarthome. For the transmission of data the standard [Homie 3.0](https://homieiot.github.io) is used.

Using Homie 3.0 it is possible to integrate Smart Pool Controller directly in open source smarthome server [openHAB](https://www.openhab.org/).
